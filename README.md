## üìù Notes

- All timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format.
- Country codes are case-sensitive (`sg`, `sG` does not work).
- Response is always wrapped in `STATUS`, `MESSAGE`, and `OUTPUT`.

---

## üß† Developer Tips

- Use tools like **Postman** or **curl** to manually test endpoints.
- Ensure your MongoDB contains the base countries data before using `/getCities`.
- If you're using Mongoose, prefer `.lean()` to avoid circular JSON issues.
- Responses are designed to be frontend-consumable out of the box.

## üìå Example Test With `curl`

You can use `curl` to test the API directly from your terminal or Postman.

```bash
# ‚úÖ Get all countries
curl "http://localhost:3001/gapi/getCountries"

# ‚úÖ Get cities for a specific country code (e.g., Singapore)
curl "http://localhost:3001/gapi/getCities?code=SG"

# ‚úÖ Get products for a city (activities, transfers, tours)
curl "http://localhost:3001/gapi/setProducts?city=Bali&countryId=2"

# ‚úÖ Get one activity by ID
curl "http://localhost:3001/gapi/getOneActivity?id=33147"

# ‚úÖ Get one transfer by ID
curl "http://localhost:3001/gapi/getOneTransfer?id=33131"

# ‚úÖ Get one tour by ID (replace with actual ID)
curl "http://localhost:3001/gapi/getOneTour?id=12345"
```
